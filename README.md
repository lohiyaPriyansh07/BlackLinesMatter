# BlackLinesMatter ~ RoboBoyz
This Bot follow the black line on white surface and capable of solving the maze by it self. It can also avoid itself from the obstacle between the path. We programmed this bot with LSRB and PID algorithm. LSRB algorithm is useful for solving the maze. It stands for Left straight right and back which are basically the prefrence of the turns at any junction. PID stands for Propotional Integral and Derivative. It is feedback loop control system algorithm.
